# 6-11. Cities: 

# Make a dictionary called cities. 
# Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary. 
# Create a dictionary of information about each city 
# and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, 
# and one fact about that city. 
# The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like country, 
# population, and fact. 
# Print the name of each city and all of the information 
# you have stored about it.
